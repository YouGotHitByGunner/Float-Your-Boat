You can read the technical and functional requirements on Trello https://trello.com/b/K832fzBQ/float. However, you need to be a team member for this.
In the files you will find examples which you will need to recreate with your HTML and CSS skills. 
The images you need are provided in the images folder and the background and header are located in the css folder. You are not permitted to use any other resources. If you need information on how to do stuff, you can find useful links in the Trello board or you could browse the web, whatever floats your boat... yeah, ok. I'm done. I just killed the entire thing. I'm just gonna go. Bye for now...
